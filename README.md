## Introduction
Version Control Systems (VCS) notifications are updates or alerts that inform users about changes made to a repository. 
These notifications are essential for keeping team members informed about repository activities.
Configuring these notifications typically involves setting preferences within the VCS tool or using integrations that 
support custom workflows, ensuring that the team stays synchronized and collaborative throughout the development process.
